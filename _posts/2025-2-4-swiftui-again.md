### Why

- `View Modifier`: A modifier that you apply to a view or another view modifier, producing a different version of the original value.

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/reducing-view-modifier-maintenance

with this protocol, you can
1. create a view modifier.
2. adding animations to a view.
3. handling view taps and gestures.


- `NSHostingController`: a view controller that wraps and manages a SwiftUI view hierarchy for integration into UIKit/AppKit-based applications.

- `Property Wrapper`: adds a layer of separation between code that manages how a property is stored and the code that defines a property.

- `Marco` refers to compile-time code transformations that generate repetitive or boilerplate code automatically.

- A State property always instantiates its default value when SwiftUI instantiates the view.

- `ObservableObject` vs `@Observable`.
