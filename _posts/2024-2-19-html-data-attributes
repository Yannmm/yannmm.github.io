### Why
The [data-* attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*) allows us to store extra information on HTML elements without having to use a non-semantic element or pollute the class name. They can contain information that is constantly changing, like a score in a game. It's not a good idea to put content that is visible and accessible.

**Reference**: [Using data-* attributes in JavaScript and CSS - Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer blog](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/10/using-data-attributes-in-javascript-and-css/)
  
  

### What

`data-*` custom attributes are [global attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes). `*` may be replaced by any lowercased alphabet characters (except `xml`). The attribute value must be type of `String`.
