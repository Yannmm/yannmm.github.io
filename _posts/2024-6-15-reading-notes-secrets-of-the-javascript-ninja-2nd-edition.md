### Why




### What

- JS has two pillars: a> `function`; b> `object`ã€‚

- `GUI` application's life cycle repeating two setps infinitiely: a> `Page Building`; b> `Event Handling`.

- While page building, brower will switch between parsing HTML to DOM and executing javascript code (when script node encountered) as necessary.

- HTML code is just a blueprint, DOM built from it might not be exactly the same as its original HTML.

- Browser expose global object `window`- through which all other global objects, global variables and brower APIs are accessible - to Javascript engine. 

- Browser has an environment with `single-threaded` execution model. All events, whether coming from user or server, are queued up and processed one by one.

- Functions are `first-class` objects in Javascript.

- Javascript Functins can even posess properties:
    ```
        var f = funciton() {};
        f.name = "Hanzo";
    ```

- 4 ways to define functions in Javascript:
    a> Function declarations
    b> Function expressions
    c> Arrow functions
    d> Function constructors (obsolete)
    e> Generator functions

- To immediately call to a function expression, using parentheses to signal to parser this is an expression, not a declaration:
    ```
    (function() {})(3);
    ```

- `arguments` and `this` are two implicit function parameters.

- `this` is affected by the way to invoke the function, when invoked:
    a> As a function, `this` is either `window` (nonstrict mode) or `undefined` (strict mode):
        ```
            function f1() => this; 
            function f2() { 'use strict'; return this; }
            
            f1(); // Window
            f2(); // undefined
        ```
    b> As a method, `this` refers to owner of the function property:
        ```
            function f1() => this;

            f1(); // window

            let k1 = {
                func: f1
            };
            k1.func(); // k1

            let k2 = {
                func: f1
            };
            k2.func(); // k2
        ```
    c> As a constructor, calling a function with keyword `new` will create a new empty object referenced by `this` and return the newly constructed object as the `new` operator's return value. (Explicit return value will be ignored if it's non-object.)
        ```
        function Ninja() {
            this.shout = () => this;
        }
        let n1 = new Ninja();
        ```

    d> Via the function's apply or call methods, we can set `this` explicitly.
    e> `arrow` functions inherit context from where it's defined.
    f> `bind` method create a brand-new function with `this` set explicitly.


- `Generator function` -> `iterator function`; resume / suspend. This is almost the same as `Dart Generator Function`.
You can also pick up where `yield` is suspend by call `next` with argument. It will be used as return value of yield.
The `next` method can supply value to the waiting `yield` expression, so if there is no yield expression waiting, there's nothing to supply the value to.

A generator must be one of following state: a> idle, b> executing, c> suspended, d> complete

Standard function can only be called anew. Each call creates a new execution context. But generator function's execution context is generated with the iterator and can be resume at will.

Both `return` and no code left to execute will cause generator function move to completed state.



- `Promise` is an placeholde for the result of an asynchronous task. It's either in **pending** or **resolved** state. 
I guess `catch()` method will catch any error in a chain of promises.
