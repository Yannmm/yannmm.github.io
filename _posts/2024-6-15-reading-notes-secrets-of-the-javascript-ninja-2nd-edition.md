### Why




### What

- JS has two pillars: a> `function`; b> `object`ã€‚

- `GUI` application's life cycle repeating two setps infinitiely: a> `Page Building`; b> `Event Handling`.

- While page building, brower will switch between parsing HTML to DOM and executing javascript code (when script node encountered) as necessary.

- HTML code is just a blueprint, DOM built from it might not be exactly the same as its original HTML.

- Browser expose global object `window`- through which all other global objects, global variables and brower APIs are accessible - to Javascript engine. 

- Browser has an environment with `single-threaded` execution model. All events, whether coming from user or server, are queued up and processed one by one.

- Functions are `first-class` objects in Javascript.

- Javascript Functins can even posess properties:
    ```
        var f = funciton() {};
        f.name = "Hanzo";
    ```

- 4 ways to define functions in Javascript:
    a> Function declarations
    b> Function expressions
    c> Arrow functions
    d> Function constructors (obsolete)
    e> Generator functions

- To immediately call to a function expression, using parentheses to signal to parser this is an expression, not a declaration:
    ```
    (function() {})(3);
    ```

- `arguments` and `this` are two implicit function parameters.

- `this` is affected by the way to invoke the function, when invoked:
    a> As a function, `this` is either `window` (nonstrict mode) or `undefined` (strict mode):
        ```
            function f1() => this; 
            function f2() { 'use strict'; return this; }
            
            f1(); // Window
            f2(); // undefined
        ```
    b> As a method, `this` refers to owner of the function property:
        ```
            function f1() => this;

            f1(); // window

            let k1 = {
                func: f1
            };
            k1.func(); // k1

            let k2 = {
                func: f1
            };
            k2.func(); // k2
        ```
    c> As a constructor, calling a function with keyword `new` will create a new empty object referenced by `this` and return the newly constructed object as the `new` operator's return value. (Explicit return value will be ignored if it's non-object.)
        ```
        function Ninja() {
            this.shout = () => this;
        }
        let n1 = new Ninja();
        ```

    d> Via the function's apply or call methods, we can set `this` explicitly.
    e> `arrow` functions inherit context from where it's defined.
    f> `bind` method create a brand-new function with `this` set explicitly.






- `Promise` is an placeholde for the result of an asynchronous task. It's either in **pending** or **resolved** state. 
I guess `catch()` method will catch any error in a chain of promises.

- `async` function is actually a mix of `generators` and `promises`.


- if a property can be found on the instance itself, the prototype isn't even consulted.

promise to avoid callback hell.


**Generators**

`Generators` are able to produce multiple values, on a per request basis, suspending their execution between these requests. 

One merit of generators is that its cntext is reserved and resumed between each execution. This creates an isolated environment.

Another merit is allowing treat asynchronous code in synchronous way, since it emits one value at a time.

One way to consume a sequence of generated values is using `for-of` loop:

```
function* g1() {
    yield 'a'
    yield 'b'
    yield 'c'
}

for(let weapon of g1()) {
    console.log(weapon)
}
```

Making a call to a generator does not mean the body of generator function will be executed immediately. Instead, an iterator object is created.

```
function* g1() {
    yield 'a'
    yield 'b'
    yield 'c'
}

const iterator = g2();

iterator.next(); // a
iterator.next(); // b
iterator.next(); // c
iterator.next(); // undefined

```

`next` and `yield` are zipped together and next always comes first. And, starting from the second next, you can provide arugment so it will serve as the return value of previous `yield`.

```
function* g3(name) {
    const r1 = yield('good' + ' ' + name);
    yield('bad' + ' ' + r1);
}

const iterator = g3('John');

iterator.next('A'); // good John

iterator.next('B'); // bad B
```


By using `yield*`, we yield (transfer control) to another generator.

```
function* g1() {
    yield 'a';
    yield 'b';
    yield* g2();
    yield 'c';
}

function* g2() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
}
```

`throw` is used to pass error from inside and outside of a generator.

```
function *g4() {
    try {
        yield 123;
        throw 'from inside'
    } catch(e) {
        cnsoel.log(e);
    }
}

const iterator = g4();
iterator.throw('from outside');
```

xxxxxxxxx

A generator must be one of following state: a> idle, b> executing, c> suspended, d> complete

- `Generator function` -> `iterator function`; resume / suspend. This is almost the same as `Dart Generator Function`.
You can also pick up where `yield` is suspend by call `next` with argument. It will be used as return value of yield.
The `next` method can supply value to the waiting `yield` expression, so if there is no yield expression waiting, there's nothing to supply the value to.





Both `return` and no code left to execute will cause generator function move to completed state.
