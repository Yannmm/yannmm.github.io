### 6. I/O Redirection

**Commands**

- `cat`: concatenate and print files.
- `sort`
- `uniq`: report or filter out repeated lines in a file.
- `grep`: print lines matching a pattern.
- `wc`: word, line, character, and byte countq
  - lines, words, bytes count
- `head`
- `tail`
- `tee`


To redirect standard output:

- `>`: overwrite a file.
  - ls /usr/bin > output.txt
- `>>`: append to the end of a file.
  - ls /usr/bin >> output.txt


To redirect standard error:
- `2>`:
  - ls /usr/bin 2> output.txt
- `2>>`:

To redirect both standard output and error to the same file:

- `&>`
- `&>>`
  - ls -l /bin/usr &>> ls-output.txt

To supress error messages from a comand:

- `/dev/null`
  - ls -l /bin/usr 2> /dev/null

In the absence of filename arguments, cat copies standard input to standard output. To create a short text file:

```
cat > some_file.txt
This is the content of text file.(Ctrl-d, Ctrl-c)
```

**Pipelines**

The standard output of one command can be `piped` into the standard input of another:

```
command1 | command2
```

- command1 `>` file: redirection operator connets a command with a file.
- command1 `|` command2: pipeline operator connects t he output of one command with the input of a second command.



(`l` seems a shortcut to `ls -lh`)
