### Why

  
  

### What

- The keyword `class` is actually an operator in Ruby. It open a tunnel connecting to the scope of a certain object, where you can do stuffs like adding instance methods.

- Constants are references as well. So they can be changed to refer to something else.

- Any reference beginning with an uppercase letter are Constants, including classes and modules. They are arranged  in a tree similar to the linux file system, where modules and classes are directories and constants are files. The constant path uses `::` as separator.

- A leading `::` stands for root.
