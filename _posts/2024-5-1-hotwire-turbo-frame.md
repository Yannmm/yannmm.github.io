title: Hotwire - Turbo Frame

### Why

`Turbo Drive`  is a drop-in replacement that enables speeding up navigation.

`Turbo Frame` allows predefined parts of a page to be updated on request. Any links and forms inside a frame are captured, and the frame contents automatically updated after receiving a response. 

Frames are created by wrapping a segment of the page in a  `<turbo-frame>`  element. Each element must have a unique ID, which is used to match the content being replaced when requesting new pages from the server. A single page can have multiple frames, each establishing their own context.

In most cases, requests that originate from a `<turbo-frame>` are expected to fetch content for that frame (or for another part of the page, depending on the use of the `target` or `data-turbo-frame` attributes). This means the response should always contain the expected `<turbo-frame>` element. If a response is missing the `<turbo-frame>` element that Turbo expects, itâ€™s considered an error; when it happens Turbo will write an informational message into the frame, and throw an exception.
