# Nix Language Basics

**General Rule**

- lazy evaluation, which means computes values when needed. (try to prepend `:p` in nix repl.)

- pure expression: declaring data and transform it with functions.

- values:
  - primitives
    - string
      - interpolation
      - file system path
      - lookup path: <nixpkgs> (try to avoid, since it's impurities)
        - Whenever a file system path is used in string interpolation, the contents of that file are copied to a special location in the file system, the Nix store, as a side effect.
        - `/nix/store/<hash>-<name>`
      - indented string '' ''
  - list
  - attribute set
  - function

- assign names to values:
  - attribute set
  - let expression
    - order of assignment does not matter.
    - with

- `;` is used to delimit expressons. last expresson should omit it.

- inherit

- string interpolation: `${...}`, only works for string values.

- funciton
  - only takes on argument.
  - argument and function body are separated by `:`.
  - default arguments: `let f = {a, b ? 0}: a + b; in f {a = 1;}`
  - additional arguments `let f = {a, b, ...}: a + b; in f { a = 1; b = 2; c = 3;}`
  - @ pattern: {a, b, ...}@args: a + b + args.c

  **builtins lib**

  - primitive operations (primops)

  - `import` is available at top level.
    - a classic pattern is to apply argument to the imported function: `import ./file.nix 1`

  - fetchers: Files to be used as build inputs do not have to come from the file system.
    - builtins.fetchurl
    - builtins.fetchTarball
    - builtins.fetchGit
    - builtins.fetchClosure
    - These functions evaluate to a file system path in the Nix store.

  **pkgs.lib**


  **Derivations**

  core of bot nix and nix language.

  - The Nix language is used to describe derivations.
  - Nix runs derivations to produce build results.
  - Build results can in turn be used as inputs for other derivations.
  - compared to impore `derivation` function, `stdenv.mkDerication` is more common.
  - The result of above functions is an attr set with certian structure and a special property: when user in string interpolation, it will evelautes to the nix store path of the build result.

  ??? stop at worked examples. https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language

### Language

Ways to assign name to value:
- attrbute sets
- `let...in...` expressions
- function arguments

**Functions**

- A function always takes exactly one argument.
- Argument and function body are separated by `:`.
  - On its left is the function argument.
  - On its right is the function body.

### What

**Nix Ecosystem**

- nix package manager
  - non-FHS compliant
  - declarative configuration (versus imperative approach)
- nix language
  - like JSON with functions
- NixOS
- nixpgks
  - more than 10000 packages
  - builder functions
    - mkShell
  - utility functions

### How

- To check `nix store` disk usage: `du -hsc /nix/store`.
- To reduce nix store disk uage: `nix-collect-garbage`.
- For the design of nix, same servide will be launched for differernt project. To avoid conflicts, we can assign differernt ports for them. And kill those service on leave `nix shell`.


A samll discovery of rails. Rails will use `PGPORT` env variable, if it's defined, and use that port to connect to psql.

- Here is how to quit on exit shell: https://github.com/legendofmiracles/lila/blob/nix/shell.nix

but above only works on bash. for zsh, I have no clue.



### Flake

A nix package manager feature that encforces a uniform structure for nix projects, pinning versions of dependencies in lock file.

- `nix flake init`: create a flake in the current directory from a template.
- `nix flake show`: show outputs of a flake.
- `nix flake metadata`: show flake metadata.

**Structure**

- description: a string
- inputs: an attrset
- outputs: a function that takes `self` (current flake) and `inputs` as arguments.

```
{
  description = "A very basic flake";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs?ref=nixos-unstable";
    home-manager.url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
    home-manager.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixkpgs"; /* home-manager will use nixkpgs from above, instead of its own version of nixpkgs. */
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs } : /* self refers to current flake; nixpkgs is a flake from inputs */
  let
    pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.aarch64.hello;
  in
  {
    /* For nix run */
    packages.aarch64.default = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.aarch64.hello; /* hello is one of ouputs of nixkpgs flake. */
    
    /* For nix develop */
    devShells.aarch64.default = pkgs.mkShell { /* mkShell is a function from nixpkgs outputs. */
      buildInputs = [pkgs.vim];
    }

    /* For NixOS */
    nixosConfigurations.nixos = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        ({ pkgs, ... } : {
          programs.vim.defaultEditor = true;
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```


**Commands**

- `nix run`: run a Nix application.
  - outputs.packages."SYSTEM".default
- `nix build`: build a package.
  - outpus.packages."SYSTEM".default
- `nix develop`: run a bash shell that provides the build environment of a derivation.
  - outpus.devShells."SYSTEM".default
- `nixos-rebuild`: build a nixos system.
  - outpus.nixosConfigurations."HOSTNAME"
- `home-manager`: build a home configuration.
  - outputs.homeConfigurations."USERNAME"

### Overlay

Overlays are Nix functions which accept two arguments, conventionally called `final` and `prev`, returning a set of packages, to customize Nixpkgs. Please check out [this article](https://nixcademy.com/posts/mastering-nixpkgs-overlays-techniques-and-best-practice/) for detail. 



### Nix Flake & Ruby on Rails

[This](https://github.com/the-nix-way/nix-flake-dev-environments/blob/main/ruby-on-rails/flake.nix) is a sample project to set up ROR dev env by flake.
