use `nix develop` to spawn a shell with an application's development dependenciesin scope. To achieve this, you should create a flake that uses `mkShell`.


TBD

### What



### How

- To check `nix store` disk usage: `du -hsc /nix/store`.
- To reduce nix store disk uage: `nix-collect-garbage`.
- For the design of nix, same servide will be launched for differernt project. To avoid conflicts, we can assign differernt ports for them. And kill those service on leave `nix shell`.


A samll discovery of rails. Rails will use `PGPORT` env variable, if it's defined, and use that port to connect to psql.

- Here is how to quit on exit shell: https://github.com/legendofmiracles/lila/blob/nix/shell.nix

but above only works on bash. for zsh, I have no clue.
