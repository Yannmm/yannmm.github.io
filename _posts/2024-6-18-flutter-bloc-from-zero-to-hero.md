### Why

For any application with user interface, generally it does and only does two things: a> handle events; b> render pages. One as input and the other as output.

We can assume the application is always in certian state (which has corresponding UI to reflect this state), that can be enumerated. A good developer will think of every possible case and have a state emerging from it.

Bloc is a state management design pattern, as well as a library.
